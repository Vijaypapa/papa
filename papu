Dear HR Manager,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally resign from my position as a Senior Software Engineer at QX Global Group.

This decision has been difficult, but due to personal reasons, I believe it is the right time for me to step down. I am deeply appreciative of the opportunities, support, and guidance I have received during my time here. It has been a pleasure working with such a talented team, and I have learned a great deal professionally and personally.

During my notice period, I am fully committed to ensuring a smooth transition and will do everything I can to complete pending tasks and facilitate the handover process.

Thank you again for your understanding. I look forward to staying in touch and wish the team and the company continued success.


Sincerely,
Vijay Choudhary
Senior Software Engineer
