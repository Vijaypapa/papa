To ensure that the `Outstanding` value is calculated correctly for `SIStatus = 4`, particularly for the first occurrence where `SIStatus = 4`, you can modify the logic to check if the current row is the first instance of `SIStatus = 4` for each `PurchaseOrderNo` and `NominalCode`. 

Hereâ€™s how you can adjust the query:

1. **Calculate the `Outstanding` value as before.**
2. **Ensure that for the first row with `SIStatus = 4`, `Outstanding` is calculated as `TotalPOAmount - InvoiceAmount`.**

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT   
        ISNULL(po.PurchaseOrderNo, '') AS PurchaseOrderNo,    
        ISNULL(podetailgroup.NominalCode, '') AS NominalCode,    
        podetailgroup.TotalPO AS TotalPOAmount,    
        ISNULL(SIDetail.SITotalAmount, 0) + ISNULL(SIDetail.Delivery, 0) AS InvoiceAmount,  
        SI.StatusId AS SIStatus,    
        SI.InvoiceCreateDate AS SICreatedDate,    
        po.CreatedDate,
        
        -- Calculate the row number for ordering within each PurchaseOrderNo and NominalCode
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY po.PurchaseOrderNo, podetailgroup.NominalCode ORDER BY SI.InvoiceCreateDate) AS RowNumber,

        -- Calculate the cumulative sum of InvoiceAmount
        SUM(ISNULL(SIDetail.SITotalAmount, 0) + ISNULL(SIDetail.Delivery, 0)) OVER (
            PARTITION BY po.PurchaseOrderNo, podetailgroup.NominalCode 
            ORDER BY SI.InvoiceCreateDate 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS CumulativeInvoiceAmount,

        -- Get the TotalPOAmount for later calculations
        podetailgroup.TotalPO AS BaseOutstanding

        SELECT podetail.PurchaseOrderId AS PurchaseOrderId,

    ) podetailgroup ON podetailgroup.PurchaseOrderId = po.PurchaseOrderId    
    LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.SupplierInvoiceDetails AS SIDetail WITH (NOLOCK) 
        ON podetailgroup.NominalCodeId = SIDetail.NominalCodeId    
        AND SI.SupplierInvoiceId = SIDetail.SupplierInvoiceId    
    WHERE po.PurchaseOrderNo IN ('A001/2023/2244', 'A016/2023/662')
    AND NominalCode IN ('50250', '71030')
)

, CTE_Cumulative AS (
    SELECT
        PurchaseOrderNo,
        NominalCode,

        CASE 
            -- If Status is 3, set Outstanding to TotalPOAmount
            WHEN SIStatus = 3 THEN TotalPOAmount

            -- If Status is 4, calculate cumulative Outstanding value
            WHEN SIStatus = 4 THEN 
                BaseOutstanding - 
                CumulativeInvoiceAmount

            -- Default case if neither 3 nor 4
            ELSE TotalPOAmount 
        END AS Outstanding
    FROM CTE
)

-- Final calculation to adjust Outstanding for the first occurrence of SIStatus = 4
, CTE_Final AS (
    SELECT 
        PurchaseOrderNo,
        NominalCode,
        TotalPOAmount,
        InvoiceAmount,

        -- Identify the first occurrence of SIStatus = 4
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY PurchaseOrderNo, NominalCode ORDER BY SICreatedDate) AS RowNum
    FROM CTE_Cumulative
)

SELECT 
    PurchaseOrderNo,
    NominalCode,
    TotalPOAmount,
    InvoiceAmount,

    CASE
        -- For SIStatus = 4, set Outstanding to TotalPOAmount - InvoiceAmount for the first row only
        WHEN SIStatus = 4 AND RowNum = 1 THEN TotalPOAmount - InvoiceAmount
        
        -- For SIStatus = 4, if Outstanding equals InvoiceAmount, set Outstanding to 0
        WHEN SIStatus = 4 AND Outstanding = InvoiceAmount THEN 0
        
        -- For SIStatus = 4, if Outstanding is less than 0 but greater than InvoiceAmount, set Outstanding to Outstanding
        WHEN SIStatus = 4 AND Outstanding < 0 THEN Outstanding
        
        -- Otherwise, use the calculated Outstanding
        ELSE Outstanding
    END AS Outstanding,

    SIStatus,    
    SICreatedDate,    
    CreatedDate
FROM CTE_Final
ORDER BY PurchaseOrderNo, SIStatus, SICreatedDate;
```

### Explanation:

1. **CTE**: Calculates basic values and cumulative sums.
2. **CTE_Cumulative**: Calculates initial `Outstanding` values.
3. **CTE_Final**: Adds a row number for each `PurchaseOrderNo` and `NominalCode` based on `SICreatedDate`.
4. **Final SELECT**:
   - For the first row with `SIStatus = 4`, the `Outstanding` is calculated as `TotalPOAmount - InvoiceAmount`.
   - For other `SIStatus = 4` rows, additional logic ensures that `Outstanding` is correctly adjusted or set to 0.

This approach should correctly handle the scenario where you want to set the `Outstanding` to `TotalPOAmount - InvoiceAmount` for the first occurrence of `SIStatus = 4`, and adjust the values accordingly for other rows.
