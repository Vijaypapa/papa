sharepoint file have already 9749 records
for example input file have 100 records and table have already 500 records then now total records will 600 and will create export file of 600 records
now for sharepoint file we have ro skip first 9749 records and insert 600 new records in sharepoint file after 9749 rows so it will
9749+600 records in sharepoint file now if a new file of 100 records insert into table then in sharepoint
9749+600+100 rows data.
