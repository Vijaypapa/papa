we need actual calculation of Outstanding on behalf of PurchaseOrderNo and SIStatus that written in below mention data -
PurchaseOrderNo	NominalCode	TotalPOAmount	InvoiceAmount	Outstanding	SIStatus	AuthoriserDate	POType	Siteid
A001/2023/2244	71030	8430	8430	8430	3	57:00.5	Budgeted OPEX	44
A001/2023/2244	71030	8430	8430	0	4	57:00.5	Budgeted OPEX	44
A016/2023/662	50250	3416.9	0	3416.9	4	20:55.4	Budgeted OPEX	59
A016/2023/662	50250	3416.9	0	3416.9	4	20:55.4	Budgeted OPEX	59
A016/2023/662	50250	3416.9	0	3416.9	4	20:55.4	Budgeted OPEX	59

but we are getting wrong calculation of Outstanding on behalf of PurchaseOrderNo and SIStatus that written in below mention data -
PurchaseOrderNo	NominalCode	TotalPOAmount	InvoiceAmount	Outstanding	SIStatus	UniqueInvoiceNo
A001/2023/2244	71030	8430	8430	8430	3	6245
A001/2023/2244	71030	8430	8430	-8430	4	6247
A016/2023/662	50250	3416.9	0	3416.9	4	6003
A016/2023/662	50250	3416.9	0	3416.9	4	6002
A016/2023/662	50250	3416.9	0	3416.9	4	6001
A016/2023/662	50250	3416.9	769.5	2647.4	4	6000

so what is wrong here is that for same PurchaseOrderNo number if SIStatus is 3 then it will write Outstanding same as TotalPOAmount but 
where SIStatus is 4 it will subtract Outstanding = Outstanding - InvoiceAmount. it is cumulative process.
so for example Outstanding of row number 2 will Outstanding of row number 1 - InvoiceAmount of row number 2
and Outstanding of row number 3 will Outstanding of row number 2 - InvoiceAmount of row number 3
where PurchaseOrderNo is same and SIStatus is 4
for different PurchaseOrderNo it will do seperate calculation for that perticular PurchaseOrderNo
