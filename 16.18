To correct the calculation of `Outstanding` values while allowing for negative values when necessary, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cumulative `InvoiceAmount` up to the current row.**
2. **Subtract this cumulative sum from the initial `TotalPOAmount` to get the correct `Outstanding` value for each row.**

The main adjustment here is to ensure that the `Outstanding` value is calculated correctly based on the cumulative sum of `InvoiceAmount` up to the current row.

Hereâ€™s how you can adjust the SQL query to implement the correct logic:

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT   
        ISNULL(po.PurchaseOrderNo, '') AS PurchaseOrderNo,    
        ISNULL(podetailgroup.NominalCode, '') AS NominalCode,    
        podetailgroup.TotalPO AS TotalPOAmount,    
        ISNULL(SIDetail.SITotalAmount, 0) + ISNULL(SIDetail.Delivery, 0) AS InvoiceAmount,  
        SI.StatusId AS SIStatus,    
        SI.InvoiceCreateDate AS SICreatedDate,    
        po.CreatedDate,
        
        -- Calculate the row number for ordering within each PurchaseOrderNo and NominalCode
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY po.PurchaseOrderNo, podetailgroup.NominalCode ORDER BY SI.InvoiceCreateDate) AS RowNumber,

        -- Get the TotalPOAmount for later calculations
        podetailgroup.TotalPO AS BaseOutstanding
    FROM dbo.PurchaseOrders AS po WITH (NOLOCK)    
    INNER JOIN dbo.Suppliers AS supplier WITH (NOLOCK) ON supplier.SupplierId = po.SupplierId    
    LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.SupplierInvoices AS SI WITH (NOLOCK) ON SI.PurchaseOrderId = po.PurchaseOrderId    
    INNER JOIN (    
        SELECT podetail.PurchaseOrderId AS PurchaseOrderId,    
               podetail.NominalCodeId AS NominalCodeId,    
               ncode.NominalCode NominalCode,    
               SUM(podetail.Total + ISNULL(podetail.Delivery, 0)) AS TotalPO    
        FROM PurchaseOrdersDetails podetail    
        INNER JOIN NominalCodes ncode ON ncode.NominalCodeId = podetail.NominalCodeId    
        GROUP BY podetail.PurchaseOrderId, podetail.NominalCodeId, ncode.NominalCode    
    ) podetailgroup ON podetailgroup.PurchaseOrderId = po.PurchaseOrderId    
    LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.SupplierInvoiceDetails AS SIDetail WITH (NOLOCK) 
        ON podetailgroup.NominalCodeId = SIDetail.NominalCodeId    
        AND SI.SupplierInvoiceId = SIDetail.SupplierInvoiceId    
    WHERE po.PurchaseOrderNo IN ('A001/2023/2244', 'A016/2023/662')
    AND NominalCode IN ('50250', '71030')
)

-- Calculating the Outstanding value based on cumulative InvoiceAmount
SELECT 
    CTE.PurchaseOrderNo,
    CTE.NominalCode,
    CTE.TotalPOAmount,
    CTE.InvoiceAmount,

    CASE 
        -- If Status is 3, set Outstanding to TotalPOAmount
        WHEN CTE.SIStatus = 3 THEN CTE.TotalPOAmount

        -- If Status is 4, calculate row-wise cumulative difference
        WHEN CTE.SIStatus = 4 THEN 
            CTE.BaseOutstanding - 
            SUM(CTE.InvoiceAmount) OVER (
                PARTITION BY CTE.PurchaseOrderNo, CTE.NominalCode 
                ORDER BY CTE.RowNumber 
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
            )
        
        -- Default case if neither 3 nor 4
        ELSE CTE.TotalPOAmount 
    END AS Outstanding,

    CTE.SIStatus,    
    CTE.SICreatedDate,    
    CTE.CreatedDate
FROM CTE
ORDER BY CTE.PurchaseOrderNo, CTE.SIStatus, CTE.SICreatedDate;
```

### Key Points:
1. **`ROW_NUMBER()`**:
   - This ensures each row within a partition has a unique number based on `InvoiceCreateDate`, which is crucial for correct cumulative calculations.

2. **`SUM() OVER()`**:
   - Calculates the cumulative `InvoiceAmount` from the start of the partition up to the current row, allowing you to subtract this cumulative total from the initial `TotalPOAmount` to get the correct `Outstanding`.

3. **`PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY`**:
   - These clauses ensure the cumulative calculation is done separately for each `PurchaseOrderNo` and `NominalCode` and is ordered correctly.

4. **`CASE` Statement**:
   - Handles different `SIStatus` values: For `SIStatus = 3`, `Outstanding` is just the `TotalPOAmount`. For `SIStatus = 4`, it applies the cumulative subtraction logic.

By using this approach, you should get accurate `Outstanding` values, even if they are negative, reflecting the correct state of the outstanding amounts after processing each invoice.
