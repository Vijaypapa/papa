To ensure that the `Outstanding` calculation is correct, especially in the scenario where `SIStatus = 3`, and to correct the issue where you are getting `-8430.00` instead of `0`, you need to handle the cumulative calculation carefully.

Here's an improved approach:

1. **Handle Status 3 separately**: If the `SIStatus` is `3`, the `Outstanding` should be the `TotalPOAmount` as is.
2. **Calculate the cumulative invoice amount correctly**: For `SIStatus = 4`, calculate the cumulative total of the `InvoiceAmount` up to the current row and subtract it from the initial `TotalPOAmount`.

Hereâ€™s the corrected SQL query:

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT   
        ISNULL(po.PurchaseOrderNo, '') AS PurchaseOrderNo,    
        ISNULL(podetailgroup.NominalCode, '') AS NominalCode,    
        podetailgroup.TotalPO AS TotalPOAmount,    
        ISNULL(SIDetail.SITotalAmount, 0) + ISNULL(SIDetail.Delivery, 0) AS InvoiceAmount,  
        SI.StatusId AS SIStatus,    
        SI.InvoiceCreateDate AS SICreatedDate,    
        po.CreatedDate,
        
        -- Calculate the row number for ordering within each PurchaseOrderNo and NominalCode
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY po.PurchaseOrderNo, podetailgroup.NominalCode ORDER BY SI.InvoiceCreateDate) AS RowNumber,

        -- Calculate the cumulative sum of InvoiceAmount
        SUM(ISNULL(SIDetail.SITotalAmount, 0) + ISNULL(SIDetail.Delivery, 0)) OVER (
            PARTITION BY po.PurchaseOrderNo, podetailgroup.NominalCode 
            ORDER BY SI.InvoiceCreateDate 
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS CumulativeInvoiceAmount,

        -- Get the TotalPOAmount for later calculations
        podetailgroup.TotalPO AS BaseOutstanding
    FROM dbo.PurchaseOrders AS po WITH (NOLOCK)    
    INNER JOIN dbo.Suppliers AS supplier WITH (NOLOCK) ON supplier.SupplierId = po.SupplierId    
    LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.SupplierInvoices AS SI WITH (NOLOCK) ON SI.PurchaseOrderId = po.PurchaseOrderId    
    INNER JOIN (    
        SELECT podetail.PurchaseOrderId AS PurchaseOrderId,    
               podetail.NominalCodeId AS NominalCodeId,    
               ncode.NominalCode NominalCode,    
               SUM(podetail.Total + ISNULL(podetail.Delivery, 0)) AS TotalPO    
        FROM PurchaseOrdersDetails podetail    
        INNER JOIN NominalCodes ncode ON ncode.NominalCodeId = podetail.NominalCodeId    
        GROUP BY podetail.PurchaseOrderId, podetail.NominalCodeId, ncode.NominalCode    
    ) podetailgroup ON podetailgroup.PurchaseOrderId = po.PurchaseOrderId    
    LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.SupplierInvoiceDetails AS SIDetail WITH (NOLOCK) 
        ON podetailgroup.NominalCodeId = SIDetail.NominalCodeId    
        AND SI.SupplierInvoiceId = SIDetail.SupplierInvoiceId    
    WHERE po.PurchaseOrderNo IN ('A001/2023/2244', 'A016/2023/662')
    AND NominalCode IN ('50250', '71030')
)

-- Calculating the Outstanding value based on cumulative InvoiceAmount
SELECT 
    CTE.PurchaseOrderNo,
    CTE.NominalCode,
    CTE.TotalPOAmount,
    CTE.InvoiceAmount,

    CASE 
        -- If Status is 3, set Outstanding to TotalPOAmount
        WHEN CTE.SIStatus = 3 THEN CTE.TotalPOAmount

        -- If Status is 4, calculate row-wise cumulative difference
        WHEN CTE.SIStatus = 4 THEN 
            CTE.BaseOutstanding - 
            CTE.CumulativeInvoiceAmount
        
        -- Default case if neither 3 nor 4
        ELSE CTE.TotalPOAmount 
    END AS Outstanding,

    CTE.SIStatus,    
    CTE.SICreatedDate,    
    CTE.CreatedDate
FROM CTE
ORDER BY CTE.PurchaseOrderNo, CTE.SIStatus, CTE.SICreatedDate;
```

### Explanation:
1. **`SUM(ISNULL(SIDetail.SITotalAmount, 0) + ISNULL(SIDetail.Delivery, 0)) OVER (...) AS CumulativeInvoiceAmount`**:
   - This computes the cumulative invoice amount up to the current row, which is necessary for calculating the `Outstanding` value correctly.

2. **`CASE` Statement**:
   - For `SIStatus = 3`, it sets the `Outstanding` to `TotalPOAmount`.
   - For `SIStatus = 4`, it calculates the `Outstanding` as the `BaseOutstanding` minus the cumulative invoice amount.

This should resolve the issue with incorrect `Outstanding` values, ensuring that negative values are properly handled while also getting the correct `Outstanding` values for each row.
