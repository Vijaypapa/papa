The issue you're experiencing seems to be due to how the cumulative sum is calculated, especially for rows where the `SIStatus = 4`. For `SIStatus = 4`, the logic should indeed perform the subtraction: `Outstanding = TotalPOAmount - InvoiceAmount`, and it looks like it's not correctly accounting for that.

Let me break down the fix:

### Solution
For `SIStatus = 4`, you need to ensure that each row calculates the outstanding amount using the difference between `TotalPOAmount` and the **cumulative sum** of `InvoiceAmount` from all previous rows (including the current one) for the same `PurchaseOrderNo` and `NominalCodeId`.

I'll modify the query to correct the behavior for `SIStatus = 4`.

### Revised Query
```sql
SELECT   
    ISNULL(po.PurchaseOrderNo, '') AS PurchaseOrderNo,    
    ISNULL(podetailgroup.NominalCode, '') AS NominalCode,    
    podetailgroup.TotalPO AS TotalPOAmount,    
    ISNULL(SIDetail.SITotalAmount, 0) + ISNULL(SIDetail.Delivery, 0) AS InvoiceAmount,  

    CASE 
        -- If Status is 3, set Outstanding to TotalPOAmount (since it's the first invoice)
        WHEN SI.StatusId = 3 THEN podetailgroup.TotalPO  
        
        -- If Status is 4, perform cumulative subtraction of InvoiceAmount from TotalPOAmount
        WHEN SI.StatusId = 4 THEN 
            podetailgroup.TotalPO - 
            SUM(ISNULL(SIDetail.SITotalAmount, 0) + ISNULL(SIDetail.Delivery, 0))
            OVER (
                PARTITION BY podetailgroup.PurchaseOrderId, podetailgroup.NominalCodeId 
                ORDER BY SI.InvoiceCreateDate, SI.SupplierInvoiceId 
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
            )
        
        -- Default case if neither 3 nor 4, use TotalPOAmount as fallback
        ELSE podetailgroup.TotalPO 
    END AS Outstanding,
 
    SI.StatusId AS SIStatus,    
    SI.InvoiceCreateDate AS SICreatedDate,    
    po.CreatedDate    
FROM dbo.PurchaseOrders AS po WITH (NOLOCK)    
INNER JOIN dbo.Suppliers AS supplier WITH (NOLOCK) ON supplier.SupplierId = po.SupplierId    
LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.SupplierInvoices AS SI WITH (NOLOCK) ON SI.PurchaseOrderId = po.PurchaseOrderId    
INNER JOIN (    
    SELECT podetail.PurchaseOrderId AS PurchaseOrderId,    
           podetail.NominalCodeId AS NominalCodeId,    
           ncode.NominalCode NominalCode,    
           SUM(podetail.Total + ISNULL(podetail.Delivery, 0)) AS TotalPO    
    FROM PurchaseOrdersDetails podetail    
    INNER JOIN NominalCodes ncode ON ncode.NominalCodeId = podetail.NominalCodeId    
    GROUP BY podetail.PurchaseOrderId, podetail.NominalCodeId, ncode.NominalCode    
) podetailgroup ON podetailgroup.PurchaseOrderId = po.PurchaseOrderId    
LEFT OUTER JOIN dbo.SupplierInvoiceDetails AS SIDetail WITH (NOLOCK) ON podetailgroup.NominalCodeId = SIDetail.NominalCodeId    
    AND SI.SupplierInvoiceId = SIDetail.SupplierInvoiceId    
WHERE po.PurchaseOrderNo IN ('A001/2023/2244', 'A016/2023/662')
AND NominalCode IN ('50250', '71030')
ORDER BY po.PurchaseOrderNo, SI.StatusId, SI.InvoiceCreateDate;
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **Cumulative Subtraction for `SIStatus = 4`**:
   - The query uses the `SUM()` window function to calculate the cumulative sum of `InvoiceAmount` (`SITotalAmount` + `Delivery`) for each row with `SIStatus = 4`.
   - This cumulative sum is subtracted from `TotalPOAmount`, ensuring that for the second row of `SIStatus = 4`, you get `0` as the outstanding amount, which is what you're expecting.

2. **Handling `SIStatus = 3`**:
   - When `SIStatus = 3`, the query sets `Outstanding` to `TotalPOAmount`, which is correct since it's the first invoice in the series.

### Expected Output for Your Data:
#### Input Data:
| PurchaseOrderNo   | NominalCode | TotalPOAmount | InvoiceAmount | SIStatus |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| A001/2023/2244    | 71030       | 8430          | 8430          | 3        |
| A001/2023/2244    | 71030       | 8430          | 8430          | 4        |
| A016/2023/662     | 50250       | 3416.9        | 769.5         | 4        |

#### Expected Output:
| PurchaseOrderNo   | NominalCode | TotalPOAmount | InvoiceAmount | Outstanding | SIStatus |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| A001/2023/2244    | 71030       | 8430          | 8430          | 8430        | 3        |
| A001/2023/2244    | 71030       | 8430          | 8430          | 0           | 4        |
| A016/2023/662     | 50250       | 3416.9        | 769.5         | 2647.4      | 4        |

### Testing:
Test this query with your data to ensure that the outstanding amount behaves as expected, particularly for rows with `SIStatus = 4`. This should now correctly calculate the outstanding amount for each Purchase Order.
